# CVE-2021-31630
OpenPLC 3 WebServer Authenticated Remote Code Execution.

# Description
The presence of Command Injection in Open PLC Webserver v3 enables remote attackers to run arbitrary code. Only tested in HTB Wifinetictwo.htb machine.

I found problems with all the scripts that exploited the vulnerability, maybe because I'm using parrot or my browser, chromium works for login, I had login problems with Firefox and something strange happens to the web server with the POST request to log in.
I have modified the script from [thewhiteh4t](https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/cve-2021-31630) there are parts (mainly upload method) that are just copied, but I have changed the part that obtains the cookies from the server to launch the exploit.

I hope it helps you if you have problems with it.
