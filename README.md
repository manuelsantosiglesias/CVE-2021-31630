# CVE-2021-31630
OpenPLC 3 WebServer Authenticated Remote Code Execution.

#Description
The presence of Command Injection in Open PLC Webserver v3 enables remote attackers to run arbitrary code by exploiting the "Hardware Layer Code Box" component found on the "/hardware" page of the application. Only tested in Wifinetictwo.htb machine from hackthebox.
I found problems with all the scripts that exploited the vulnerability, maybe because I'm using parrot or my browser, chromium works for login, I had login problems with Firefox and something strange happens to the web server with the POST request to log in.

I have modified the script from https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/cve-2021-31630 there are parts that are just copied, but I have changed the part that obtains the cookies from the server to launch the exploit.

I hope it helps you if you have problems with it.

#Dependencies
```
pip3 install requests
